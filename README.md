## Setup

### Using Docker

1. Download and customize [`config.yaml`](https://github.com/duolingo/metasearch/raw/master/config.yaml)
1. In the local directory that contains `config.yaml`, run `docker run -p 3000:3000 -v "$PWD:/data" duolingo/metasearch`

### Using Git, Make, and Node.js

1. Clone this repo and customize its `config.yaml`
1. Run `make`

Metasearch runs at http://localhost:3000.

## Contributing

Want to search something like SharePoint or MediaWiki that isn't currently supported? This repo is only around 3000 lines of TypeScript, and [adding support](https://github.com/duolingo/metasearch/pull/11) for a new data source requires fewer than 100 lines on average. Feel free to open a PR!
